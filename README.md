FIT quantifies the amount of information transmitted from a sender brain region X to a receiver brain region Y about a specific external feature S. This approach goes beyond classic methodologies to study causal communication, such as Transfer Entropy (TE), which quantify the overall activity propagated from the sender to the receiver region. By isolating the feature-specific information flowing from one region to another, FIT sheds light on the actual content of the communication.

The main scripts to compute FIT, cFIT and Transfer Entropy (TE) from discrete data are compute_FIT.m, compute_cFIT.m, and compute_TE.m, respectively.
These scripts take as an input a set of discrete arrays, representing neural responses at specific time points (i.e. the past/present activity of the sender and receiver regions) and external features of interest sampled across experimental trials.

The example_FIT_TE.m script shows an example application of compute_FIT and compute_TE on simulated data.

The software has been tested with MATLAB version R2021a, no further dependencies are required. The software is released under the MIT license.
