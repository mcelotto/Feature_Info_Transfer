MATLAB implementation of Feature-specific Information Transfer (FIT) and conditional FIT (cFIT) measures associated to the paper:
M. Celotto et al. An information-theoretic quantification of the content of communication between brain regions. biorXiv, 2023

The main scripts to compute FIT, cFIT and Transfer Entropy (TE) are compute_FIT.m, compute_cFIT.m, and compute_TE.m, respectively.

The example_FIT_TE.m script shows an example application of compute_FIT and compute_TE.
