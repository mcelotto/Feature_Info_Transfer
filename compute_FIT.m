function FIT = compute_FIT(feature, X, Y, hY)
% This function computes the Feature-specific Information Transfer (FIT)

% input: 
% feature = discrete feature value (1 x trials)
% X = discrete past activity of the sender X_past (1 x trials)
% Y = discrete present activity of the receiver Y_pres (1 x trials)
% hY = discrete past activity of the receiver Y_past (1 x trials)

% output:
% FIT = Feature-specific Information Transfer value (from X to Y about S)
