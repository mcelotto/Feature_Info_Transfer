function FIT = compute_FIT(feature, X, Y, hY)
% This function contains the core routine to compute Feature-specific Information Transfer (FIT) 
% from a sender region X to a receiver region Y. 
% The function takes as an input the discrete feature value (F), 
% and the discrete values of X past, Y present and Y past measured across trials. 
% Then, it builds the four-dimensional probability distribution p(F,X,Y,hY) by
% counting the number of joint occurrences of each possible combination of the
% four variables across trials. Lastly, it uses the PID I_min measure to compute
% the two Shared Unique Information atoms appearing in FIT definition.

% input: 
% feature = discrete feature value (1 x trials)
% X = discrete past activity of the sender X_past (1 x trials)
% Y = discrete present activity of the receiver Y_pres (1 x trials)
% hY = discrete past activity of the receiver Y_past (1 x trials)
%
% Continuous-valued features and activity can be used to discretized
% using the eqpop_binning.m function in \auxiliary 

% output:
% FIT = Feature-specific Information Transfer value (from X to Y about S)

% Build the two four-variables probability distributions needed to compute FIT
pXYhYS = probabilityDist(X, Y, hY, feature); % probability distribution for the PID with (Xp, Yp, Yt) as sources and S as target
pXShYY = probabilityDist(X, feature, hY, Y); % probability distribution for the PID with (Xp, Yp, S) as sources and Yt as target

% Compute the two FIT atoms
SUI_S = compute_SUI(pXYhYS);
SUI_Y = compute_SUI(pXShYY);

FIT = min(SUI_S,SUI_Y);
