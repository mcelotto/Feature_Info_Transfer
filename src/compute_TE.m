function te = compute_TE(feature, X, Y, hY)
% This function computes the Transfer Entropy (TE) from sender region X to receiver region Y 
% (see Schreiber T. (2000) Phys Rev Letters, for the measure definition)

% input: 
% feature = discrete feature value (1 x trials). Feature input is not used to compute TE, but is taken as input to use the same function used for FIT to estimate  probability distributions
% X = discrete past activity of the sender X_past (1 x trials)
% Y = discrete present activity of the receiver Y_pres (1 x trials)
% hY = discrete past activity of the receiver Y_past (1 x trials)
%
% Continuous-valued activity can be used to discretized
% using the eqpop_binning.m function in \auxiliary 

% output:
% te = transfer entropy value
