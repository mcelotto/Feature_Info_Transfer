function cFIT = compute_cFIT( feature, X, Y, hY, hZ)
% This function contains the core routine to compute conditional FIT (FIT) 
% from a sender region X to a receiver region Y, given the activity of a third region Z. 
% The function takes as an input the discrete feature value (F), 
% and the discrete values of X past, Y present, Y past and Z past measured across trials. 
% Then, it builds the five-dimensional probability distribution p(F,X,Y,hY,Z) by
% counting the number of joint occurrences of each possible combination of the
% five variables across trials. Lastly, it uses the PID I_min measure to compute
% the two information atoms appearing in cFIT definition.

% input: 
% feature = discrete feature value (1 x trials)
% X = discrete past activity of the sender X_past (1 x trials)
% Y = discrete present activity of the receiver Y_pres (1 x trials)
% hY = discrete past activity of the receiver Y_past (1 x trials)
% hZ = discrete past activity of the third region Z_past (1 x trials)

% output:
% cFIT = conditioned Feature-specific Information Transfer value (from X to Y about S, given Z)
